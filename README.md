This project is a responsive webpage that  fetches current news article
(abstracts), URL's and related images from the New York Times API and appends 
it on the webpage. It's fully compatible for mobile, tablet and desktop
and delivers a preloader to give user's a visual on loading to clarify its
loading appropriately.

<!--------------TECHNOLOGIES AND STYLES USED-------------->
This project a handful technology I used was Gulp. Gulp is a node module
task runner that allowed me to work on my project without disrupting my 
developement work flow. I was allowed to save without having to manually refreshing the page as well. Gulp
was really helpful in minifying my project and getting rid of all the excessive
white space. I was able to set rules in my code and Gulp reminded me if any 
rules were being broken. As for errors, it gave me information on how and 
where the error occured. A type of style I used to handle my CSS files was 
putting elements in partials. Partials kept my code organized, and easy to
navigate through. Using SASS helped with my @mediaqueries alot, it gave me
the option to put breakpoints under the element I'm styling and I wasn't forced
to go back and forth.

<!------------------WHAT DID I LEARN------------------>
In this project I learned alot about animations. It gives users a subtle, but
amazing touch the webpage. Last project I got comments to validate my code, and
I this project I validated during and after my project.


I learned how flexbox can be really powerful , and learned
from my last project I should have implemented it, instead
of trying to use percentages to fit the screen. I used to put
display:flex on alot of unneccessary elements because my code
was hard to read and I didnt understand display:flex as much and
it would disorient my heights/widths and that led me to give up.
I understand now its only used on the parent that needs display:flex
.I also used an overflow propery and it's really helpful for keeping things 
on the screen. I had the problem where my images were going off the page
or users would need to side scroll to see it, but with overflow
it kept it hidden and removed the side scroll all together.I also learned
about using flex-direction to move my logo and select box to 
where I would want it.

Having ESlint and giving it rules it really hand and keep your code under
a chartered set of rules to keep code structured.

    Using the AJAX method 'GET' I was able to get all the 
    information I needed. Now I understand API's and how they work and
to match them with my selector adding UserInput to the URL and 
making a variable from it. 'console.log' became very helpful
to make sure I'm logging certain data at every point for specific
kinds of data while I was navigating or 'traversing' through
the DOM tree. ES

I started to use comments on my main.js to keep organized and not have to keep wondering
which closing bracket matches with each method/function. Node mo

    Learning to concatenate strings was very understable once I realized to just break it down and
connect it with '+' signs. I took full advantage of addClass
understand now its amazing and simple to understand and be able
to move and resize objects on a certain function. The select
element was really cool ! It was neccesary for appending
API's with certain sections and gave me insight on 
how to give users options to choose from. Finally, one of the
most important things I learned was to clean up my code
and make it obvious to differ children and parents and 
take out commented code that I didn't need.

Overall this project was really good, and I learned alot !
